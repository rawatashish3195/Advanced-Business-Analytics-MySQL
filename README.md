# Advanced-Business-Analytics-MySQL
End-to-end MySQL project focused on business analytics using advanced SQL queries.

This project is a complete **MySQL-based business analytics project** designed to practice and demonstrate real-world SQL skills used by data analysts.

The goal of this project is not just to store data, but to **analyze business performance** using SQL queries such as revenue analysis, customer behavior, branch performance, and order insights.

All queries were written and tested in **MySQL Workbench**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The database represents a simplified business that operates across multiple branches and serves customers through orders and payments.

Using this database, I performed **analytical queries** to answer real business questions like:
- How much revenue is generated?
- Who are the top customers?
- Which branches contribute the most revenue?
- What is the average order value?

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- MySQL 8
- MySQL Workbench
- SQL (Joins, Subqueries, Aggregations, Group By, Having)
- GitHub (for version control)

---

## 🗂 Database Schema

The database contains the following tables:

- customers  
- categories  
- products  
- branches  
- departments  
- employees  
- orders  
- order_items  
- payments  

The schema is normalized and uses **primary keys and foreign keys** to maintain data integrity.

## 📊 Business Questions Answered

The project answers the following key business questions:

1. Total revenue from delivered orders  
2. Month-wise revenue trend  
3. Top 3 customers by revenue  
4. Revenue contribution by product  
5. Customers with above-average revenue  
6. Branch-wise revenue  
7. Average Order Value (AOV)  
8. Customers with more than one order  
9. Customers who never placed an order  
10. Number of orders per customer  
11. Orders by status  
12. Revenue contribution percentage by branch  

These queries focus on **business insights**, not just basic SQL syntax.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned from This Project

- Writing complex JOIN queries across multiple tables  
- Using `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` for business logic  
- Understanding how revenue is calculated in real systems  
- Designing clean and scalable database schemas  
- Debugging and validating SQL queries using MySQL Workbench  

---

## ▶️ How to Run This Project

1. Open MySQL Workbench  
2. Run `01_schema.sql` to create the database and tables  
3. Run `02_insert_data.sql` to insert sample data  
4. Run queries from `03_analytical_queries.sql` to view insights  

---

## 📌 Notes

- Sample data is intentionally kept small for readability.
- All queries are designed to **scale for large datasets**.
- This project focuses on **analysis**, not CRUD operations.
